## About
Machine learning, especially neural networks, is increasingly used beyond data science, particularly in automation and robotics. Boston Dynamics, known for robots like Spot the robot dog, builds highly accurate robots capable of navigating complex environments using sensors combined with machine learning models. The main goal of this project is to determine the robotâ€™s position using sensor data â€” for example, to simply identify whether the robot is on a flat surface. This project is not intended as a complete solution (since sensors typically handle such tasks), but rather reflects the authorâ€™s personal interest in exploring machine learning possibilities.
